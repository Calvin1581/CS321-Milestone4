# Report

### Abstract: 
This milestone involved developing a dynamic version of the Athletic Management system.  We created a database to handle athlete data and connected it to our HTML pages from the previous milestone, in addition to functional dashboards for various users, and login/signup ability.  We updated the graphs from the Corona bootstrap to Plotly so that they can be updated in real time via CSV.

### Sprint Backlog:


### Results: 
In this milestone we created a dynamic version of the Athletic Management System. Our website includes a database that stores athlete data and sources it to the pages of the website. All of the pages and clickable link are workable and link to their correct locations. A user is now able to sign up and login to the system now to see their specific data. The graph were also taken from imagees to Plotly graphs that are updateable via CSV.

### Team Reflection: 
In this milestone we held multiple in person meetings to update the group needs, issues, and duties. These were very useful and eliminated the delay of text message respones. We did a lot of our work seperately and when pull requests were made they were revised promptly. Obstacle we overcame included: our scrum master having covid, difficulties in specific code, and some organization of issues. We utilized communication and praise during code reviews during this mileston.**
