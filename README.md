### Abstract: 
This milestone involved developing a dynamic version of the Athletic Management system.  We created a database to handle athlete data and connected it to our HTML pages from the previous milestone, in addition to functional dashboards for various users, and login/signup ability.  We updated the graphs from the Corona bootstrap to Plotly so that they can be updated in real time via CSV.
